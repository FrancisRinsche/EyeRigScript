# Eye Rig Script


I really liked Marco Giordanos scripts and workflow for Cartoon Eyelids , so I extended their functionality to include more of the steps needed to achieve them.

Added Functions
<ul>
<li> saving the selected vertices </l>
<li> creating the objects with the right names and hierarchy structure </l>
<li> create curves at the vertex positions </l>
<li> creating the needed controllers and their constraints </l>
<li> creating the control joints and skinning them to the curves </l>
</ul>



Core Functions written by Marco Giordano
<ul> 
<li> saving the selected vertices </l>
